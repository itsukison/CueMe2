# Gemini API Workflow Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines the improvements made to the Gemini API workflow for the interview cheating tool to better utilize the RAG system and provide Japanese-first responses optimized for direct use.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Complete Japanese Prompt Conversion
- **Before**: Mixed English/Japanese prompts with basic Japanese instructions
- **After**: Fully Japanese system prompt specifically designed for interview assistance
- **Benefits**: More natural Japanese responses, better cultural context understanding

### 2. Enhanced RAG Integration
- **Improved Context Formatting**: RAG results now include similarity scores and are formatted as "関連知識" (Related Knowledge)
- **Better Prompt Engineering**: RAG context is naturally integrated into the system prompt
- **Lower Similarity Threshold**: Changed from 0.7 to 0.6 for better recall of relevant information
- **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging for RAG search results for debugging

### 3. Response Optimization for Direct Use
- **Removed Meta-commentary**: Eliminated phrases like "以下が回答になります" (Here is the answer)
- **Clean Response Processing**: Added `cleanResponseText()` method to remove unwanted introductory phrases
- **Interview-Ready Format**: Responses are structured to be directly usable in interview situations
- **No Source Attribution**: Information is naturally integrated without mentioning sources

### 4. Improved System Prompt Design
The new system prompt includes:
- Clear role definition as interview assistance AI
- Specific formatting guidelines for Japanese responses
- Instructions for natural information integration
- Guidelines for concise, practical responses
- Avoidance of unnecessary prefixes and meta-commentary

### 5. Enhanced Audio and Image Analysis
- **Japanese-First Approach**: All analysis methods now use Japanese prompts
- **Interview Context**: Analysis is framed in terms of interview preparation
- **Consistent Formatting**: All methods use the same response cleaning process

## Technical Changes

### Core Methods Updated:
1. `chatWithGemini()` - Basic chat functionality
2. `chatWithRAG()` - RAG-enabled chat with improved context integration
3. `formatRAGPrompt()` - Better RAG context formatting
4. `searchRAGContext()` - Enhanced search with better thresholds
5. `analyzeAudioFile()` - Japanese-first audio analysis
6. `analyzeImageFile()` - Japanese-first image analysis
7. `extractProblemFromImages()` - Japanese JSON responses
8. `generateSolution()` - Japanese solution generation
9. `debugSolutionWithImages()` - Japanese debugging assistance

### New Helper Method:
- `cleanResponseText()` - Removes unwanted phrases and formatting

## RAG System Improvements

### Better Context Integration
```typescript
// Before: Basic context listing
参考情報 1:
質問: ${result.question}
回答: ${result.answer}

// After: Enhanced context with similarity scores
【関連知識 1】
Q: ${result.question}
A: ${result.answer}
類似度: ${(result.similarity * 100).toFixed(1)}%
```

### Improved Search Strategy
- Lowered similarity threshold from 0.7 to 0.6 for better recall
- Added detailed logging for debugging RAG performance
- Enhanced error handling for RAG failures

## Usage Guidelines

### For Users:
1. **Direct Usage**: Responses can now be used directly in interviews without filtering
2. **Natural Flow**: Information from QnA files is seamlessly integrated
3. **Japanese Focus**: All responses are optimized for Japanese interview contexts

### For Developers:
1. **Debugging**: Check console logs for RAG search performance
2. **Threshold Tuning**: Adjust similarity threshold in `searchRAGContext()` if needed
3. **Response Quality**: Monitor `cleanResponseText()` effectiveness

## Expected Outcomes

1. **Better RAG Utilization**: More relevant information retrieved and naturally integrated
2. **Improved User Experience**: Responses ready for direct use without editing
3. **Enhanced Japanese Quality**: More natural, interview-appropriate Japanese responses
4. **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Users don't need to filter or reformat responses

## Future Considerations

1. **Dynamic Threshold Adjustment**: Consider adjusting similarity thresholds based on query type
2. **Context Ranking**: Implement more sophisticated ranking of RAG results
3. **Response Templates**: Consider adding interview-specific response templates
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for RAG effectiveness and response quality
